  Write a program to display the number of lines in the file and size of a file in bytes.
  
  def file_info(filename):
    try:
        with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        
            lines = file.readlines()

        
            num_lines = len(lines)

        
            file_size = file.seek(0, 2)

            
            print(f"Number of lines: {num_lines}")
            print(f"Size of file (in bytes): {file_size}")
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"File '{filename}' not found.")

filename = input("Enter the name of the file: ")

file_info(filename)

OUTPUT:-
Enter the name of the file: example.txt
Number of lines: 3
Size of file (in bytes): 45
